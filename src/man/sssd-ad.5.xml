        <para>
            This manual page describes the configuration of the AD provider
            for
            <citerefentry>
                <refentrytitle>sssd</refentrytitle>

            For a detailed syntax reference, refer to the <quote>FILE FORMAT</quote> section of the
            <citerefentry>
                <refentrytitle>sssd.conf</refentrytitle>
                <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
            </citerefentry> manual page.
        </para>
        <para>
            The AD provider is a back end used to connect to an Active
            Directory server. This provider requires that the machine be
            joined to the AD domain and a keytab is available.
        </para>
        <para>
            The AD provider supports connecting to Active Directory 2008 R2
            or later. Earlier versions may work, but are unsupported.
        </para>
        <para>
            The AD provider is able to provide identity information and
            authentication for entities from trusted domains as well. Currently
            only trusted domains in the same forest are recognized.
        </para>
        <para>
            The AD provider accepts the same options used by the
            <citerefentry>
                <refentrytitle>sssd-ldap</refentrytitle>
                <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
            </citerefentry> identity provider and the
            <citerefentry>
                <refentrytitle>sssd-krb5</refentrytitle>
                <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
            </citerefentry> authentication provider with some exceptions described
            below.
        </para>
        <para>
            However, it is neither necessary nor recommended to set these
            options. The AD provider can also be used as an access, chpass and
            sudo provider. No configuration of the access provider is required
            on the client side.
        </para>
        <para>
            By default, the AD provider will map UID and GID values from the
            objectSID parameter in Active Directory. For details on this, see
            the <quote>ID MAPPING</quote> section below. If you want to
            disable ID mapping and instead rely on POSIX attributes defined in
            Active Directory, you should set
            <programlisting>
ldap_id_mapping = False
            </programlisting>
            In order to retrieve users and groups using POSIX attributes from trusted
            domains, the AD administrator must make sure that the POSIX attributes
            are replicated to the Global Catalog.
        </para>
        <para>
            Users, groups and other entities served by SSSD are always treated as
            case-insensitive in the AD provider for compatibility with Active
            Directory's LDAP implementation.

                            This option specifies LDAP access control
                            filter that the user must match in order
                            to be allowed access. Please note that the
                            <quote>access_provider</quote> option must be
                            explicitly set to <quote>ad</quote> in order
                            for this option to have an effect.

                        <para>
                            The option also supports specifying different
                            filters per domain or forest. This
                            extended filter would consist of:
                            <quote>KEYWORD:NAME:FILTER</quote>.
                            The keyword can be either <quote>DOM</quote>,
                            <quote>FOREST</quote> or missing.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            If the keyword equals to <quote>DOM</quote>
                            or is missing, then <quote>NAME</quote> specifies
                            the domain or subdomain the filter applies to.
                            If the keyword equals to <quote>FOREST</quote>,
                            then the filter equals to all domains from the
                            forest specified by <quote>NAME</quote>.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            Multiple filters can be separated with the
                            <quote>?</quote> character, similarly to how
                            search bases work.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            The most specific match is always used. For
                            example, if the option specified filter
                            for a domain the user is a member of and a
                            global filter, the per-domain filter would
                            be applied.  If there are more matches with
                            the same specification, the first one is used.

                            By default, the SSSD connects to the Global
                            Catalog first to retrieve users from trusted
                            domains and uses the LDAP port to retrieve
                            group memberships or as a fallback. Disabling
                            this option makes the SSSD only connect to
                            the LDAP port of the current AD server.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            Please note that disabling Global Catalog support
                            does not disable retrieving users from trusted
                            domains. The SSSD would connect to the LDAP port
                            of trusted domains instead. However, Global
                            Catalog must be used in order to resolve
                            cross-domain group memberships.

                            This option specifies the operation mode for
                            GPO-based access control functionality:
                            whether it operates in disabled mode, enforcing
                            mode, or permissive mode. Please note that the
                            <quote>access_provider</quote> option must be
                            explicitly set to <quote>ad</quote> in order for
                            this option to have an effect.

                        <para>
                            GPO-based access control functionality uses GPO
                            policy settings to determine whether or not a
                            particular user is allowed to logon to a particular
                            host.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            NOTE: If the operation mode is set to enforcing, it
                            is possible that users that were previously allowed
                            logon access will now be denied logon access (as
                            dictated by the GPO policy settings). In order to
                            facilitate a smooth transition for administrators,
                            a permissive mode is available that will not enforce
                            the access control rules, but will evaluate them and
                            will output a syslog message if access would have
                            been denied. By examining the logs, administrators
                            can then make the necessary changes before setting
                            the mode to enforcing.
